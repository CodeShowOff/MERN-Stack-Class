            <h2>Spider-Man</h2>

            <p>
                Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, is one of the most beloved superheroes in comic book history.
                Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, Spider-Man first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 in 1962. What sets
                Spider-Man apart from other superheroes is his relatability; Peter Parker is an ordinary teenager
                dealing with everyday problems, from schoolwork to relationships, all while balancing his secret life as
                a superhero.

                Gifted with incredible powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter gains the ability to
                cling to walls, superhuman strength, agility, and a "spider-sense" that warns him of danger. Using his
                scientific genius, he invents web-shooters that allow him to swing through the city and capture
                criminals. Despite his powers, Peter is constantly reminded that "with great power comes great
                responsibility," a lesson instilled in him by the tragic loss of his Uncle Ben.

                Spider-Man's adventures often focus on his struggle to do the right thing, even when it comes at a
                personal cost. He faces a wide array of villains, from the Green Goblin to Doctor Octopus, but his
                greatest battles are often internal. The character's enduring popularity comes from his humanityâ€”he
                makes mistakes, learns from them, and never gives up, no matter how tough things get.

                Over the years, Spider-Man has inspired countless fans through comics, television shows, and blockbuster
                movies. His story is a testament to the idea that anyone, regardless of their background, can be a hero.
                Spider-Man continues to swing into the hearts of fans worldwide, reminding us all of the importance of
                courage, responsibility, and hope.
